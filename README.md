# Undergraduate-Thesis
My undergraduate thesis completed as part of the my requirements for obtaining my bachelor in physics. My research here is to develop a low energy (<100 keV) neutron source for use with bubble chamber calibrations within the PICO collaboration. Included here is my thesis, analysis code and scripts, figures, and manual.

The use of bubble chambers for direct dark matter detection requires high sensitivity 
to energy levels in the range of 1-100 keV and strict measures to reduce background 
radiation. Neutrons can be used to simulate WIMP elastic scattering interactions with 
the target volume in order to ensure high detection efficiency. We aim to develop a 
low energy neutron source that will allow us to properly calibrate bubble chambers to 
ensure their ability to detect such events. We propose a solution consisting of a neutron 
source composed of a radioisotope capable of emitting gamma radiation at the required 
energy thresholds and a target capable of ejecting photoneutrons when struck by the 
gamma radiation. We have chosen seven main candidates for a gamma source, taking 
note of important properties such as half-life, availability, cost, and other factors. We 
have also calculated the theoretical energies of the neutrons emitted by each source and 
the rate at which each source would emit neutrons. We utilize the GEANT4 simulation 
software to explore various scenarios and determine effective neutron emission rates and 
the energies upon interaction with the C$_{3}$F$_{8}$. Results yielded from the Drexel 
Bubble Chamber will be useful for other members of the PICO collaboration and other 
direct detection experiments.
